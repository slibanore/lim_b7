---- LIM_b7 ----

Code used by the cosmology group at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev (Be'er Sheva, Israel) to work on LIM.

The code is based on the orginal work by Bernal et al. (see https://github.com/jl-bernal/lim for basic usage) and updated in the different branches to deal with different projects.

- main: use the VID to probe small scales (see Libanore et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01658)

- PMF: constrain primordial magnetic fields through the VID (see Adi, Libanore, Kovetz, in prep.) -- [important note: the code for PMF here is not complete, ask Tal Adi for full version]

- ULTRASAT: LIM analysis of the full sky reference map of the Israeli satellite ULTRASAT https://www.weizmann.ac.il/ultrasat/ (see Libanore, Kovetz, ULTRASAT White paper)

- nu_mass: contrain neutrino mass through LIM (see Shmueli, Libanore, Kovetz, in prep.) -- [work in progress]

- fnl: constrain inflation parameters through LIM (see Unal, Libanore, et al., in prep.) -- [work in progress]
